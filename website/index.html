			<u><h2>Background and Motivation</h2></u>
			<p>
				I have never worked with VR or with Multiplayer integration into a Unity game never seen how that process is made. This project also was chosen because I wanted to learn about VR games as in spare time, 
				I’m trying to develop games/ modifications for different already existant games and releasing them online such as maps for Counter-Strike and modifications for Minecraft and GTA V:Online.
				Learning about game development I wanted to do something that would challenge me and at the same time educate me and something that would expand my knowledge. 
				Making a VR game allowed me to get more knowledge and will help me create a future game that I would want to publicly release.
